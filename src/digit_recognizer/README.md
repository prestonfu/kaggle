# Digit Recognizer

The [MNIST database of handwritten images](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) has long served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. In this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview), we aim to correctly identify digits. We achieve a public score of 0.98535 with a CONVNet.
